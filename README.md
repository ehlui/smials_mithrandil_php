## :bulb: Introduction
This's my jounrey on learning and understanding _web developemnt_ on my own. This is actually my first challanges I want to start while this lockdown keep me at üè†. 

:hammer: I will be updating this **README** file as long as my _sessions_ get done.


### :zap: What is this for?

One way to keep track of my daily progress (or weekly or monthly) and keep pushing myself on these kind of _100 days of coding_ challenge I just started.

- I feel like I need to expand my point of view more than back-end java or python-like projects so far.


### :heavy_check_mark: The Goal

I'd like not only to learn from this challenge but get a solid knowledge on web development and server-side elements, settings and security.

I also will be messing around docker and practicing on REST architecture and microservices.
